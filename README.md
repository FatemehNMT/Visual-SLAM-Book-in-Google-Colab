# Visual-SLAM-Book-in-Google-Colab
slambook2 and its codes in Google Colab

This is not a novel, unique, state-of-the-art project. It is in fact, an notebook for myself to gather my knowledge on Visual-SLAM in a pack, or a basic tutorial for a beginner in this field, according to [slambook2](https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook2), with more explaination and related examples.

There are many GitHub accounts providing its codes in similar or different ways and versions. In fact, it is a collected information in summery for my personal usage and learning, and there is no significant difference here in presenting them, except for trying to:
+	Introduce the subject as a basic tutorial, considering the book itself.
+	Install, run and present everything in Colab-Notebooks (although, there are some problems attached to its applying there (more specifically, when the main source is in C++)).
+	Provide more related information, algorithms and introduce some useful links.
